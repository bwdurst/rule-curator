# Apply-plan format

Steps 8-9 of the workflow: turn `decisions.json` (exported from the curation UI)
into an auditable plan, then apply it behind one confirmation.

## Contents

- Input: decisions.json
- Per-verdict edits
- Drift and staleness handling
- The apply-plan document
- The apply gate and execution

## Input: decisions.json

The curation UI exports one decision per rule:

```json
{
  "meta": { "title": "...", "exported": "..." },
  "decisions": [
    { "id": "G1", "source": "path:line", "verdict": "drop",
      "original": "...", "modifiedText": "", "notes": "" }
  ]
}
```

`verdict` is `keep`, `drop`, `modify`, or `undecided`.

## Per-verdict edits

- **keep** — no-op. Do not touch the file.
- **drop** — remove the rule from its source. For a memory entry, this means
  **both** deleting the entry file **and** removing its pointer line in
  `MEMORY.md`. One change set, both halves; a dangling pointer is a broken state.
- **modify** — replace the rule's text with `modifiedText`. If `modifiedText` is
  empty for a modify verdict, flag it and skip rather than guess the rewrite.
- **undecided** — skip; list under "needs a decision" so the human knows it was
  not applied.

## Drift and staleness handling

Compute every edit against the **current** contents of the source files at apply
time, not against the snapshot captured during curation.

- **Drifted rule:** the rule text in the file no longer matches `original`. The
  file changed since curation. Flag it, skip it, do not blind-edit.
- **Stale decision:** the `id` / rule no longer exists in the sources. Flag and
  skip.
- **Missing file:** the source file is gone. Flag and skip.

Skipped items go in the apply-plan so nothing fails silently.

## The apply-plan document

Markdown, one entry per non-keep verdict, exact before/after so a human can
review it as a diff:

```markdown
# Apply plan — <title>

## Edits (N)

### DROP · G1 · CLAUDE.md
- File: CLAUDE.md
- Remove:
  > Never commit directly to main. Every change goes through a PR.

### MODIFY · S3 · CLAUDE.md
- File: CLAUDE.md
- Before:
  > Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before every commit.
- After:
  > Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before every commit.

### DROP · M1 · memory
- Delete file: memory/feedback_pr_template.md
- Remove pointer line in memory/MEMORY.md:
  > - [PR description template](feedback_pr_template.md) — ...

## Skipped (M)
- D4 (drifted: file text no longer matches the curated original)
- N2 (undecided)
```

## The apply gate and execution

Present the plan, then ask once: "apply these N edits?" On confirmation, make the
edits exactly as listed. Where the sources live in a git repo, recommend
committing or stashing first so the apply lands as one reviewable diff. This is a
lightweight confirm-then-edit; it does not need a multi-checkpoint execution
framework.

Running unattended, do **not** auto-apply: writing back to source-of-truth rule
files is the one place the skill always stops for a human.
